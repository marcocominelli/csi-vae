This repository hosts the code used in the paper:
```
Marco Cominelli, Francesco Gringoli, Lance M. Kaplan, Mani B. Srivastava, Federico Cerutti,
"Accurate Passive Radar via an Uncertainty-Aware Fusion of Wi-Fi Sensing Data"
Accepted to the 26th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2023)
```

There are two Jupyter notebooks in this repository:

- **CSI-VAE.ipynb** contains the code used to train the different Variational Auto-Encoders presented in the paper;
- **CSI-EDL-MLP.ipynb** contains the code used to evaluate the performance of different MLP/EDL architectures, and to train a simple decision tree model.
